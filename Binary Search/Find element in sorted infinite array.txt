Search an element in sorted infinite array.
The size given is infinite.
Target element is given.

Approach: 
1. Find the lower bound and upper bound indexes where the key lies in between.
2. Then apply the Binary search.

size = infinite;


int low = 0;
int end = 1;

while(key < end){
 low = end;
 end = end * 2;
}

apply bst(low, end);
